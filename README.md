# Parallel-Autoencoder-Unsupervised-Feature-Learning
Feature engineering is a fundamental challenge in machine learning: how do we  automatically discover good representations of data that capture its underlying  structure? In this project, you will implement an Autoencoder-based unsupervised  feature learning system for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
